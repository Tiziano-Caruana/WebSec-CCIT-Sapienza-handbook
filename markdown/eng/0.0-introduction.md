# Introduction

This guide is dedicated to CyberChallenge.IT participants and, once expanded and deepened, to TRX members and enthusiasts in general. This resource aims to provide an overview of data exfiltration in web exploitation.

It is important to emphasize that this guide reflects solely my knowledge and personal opinions. I do not have direct experience in the field of cybersecurity and do not take responsibility for the misuse of the information provided here outside the context of CyberChallenge.IT and more broadly the world of CTFs.

Readers are encouraged to skip chapters or sections they already find familiar or irrelevant to their needs.
